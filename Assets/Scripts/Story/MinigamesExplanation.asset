    sentences:
    - Look! These are some magic circles our previous support set for you
    - You can go to them and use the runes that are in there to complete a task sent
      by god!
    - If you complete the task succesfully god will give you mana instantly to help
      you cast your spells
    - Once you try to solve a task, the magic circle will go on cooldown for some
      time, you have to wait until it lights up to use it again!
